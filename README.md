# OdySSI
Self Sovereign Identity track

During the Odyssey Momentum 2020 edition we've developed the OdySSI solution which we've now coined **eassi**.

**Eassi** makes SSI easy and is open source. Join us at https://github.com/tno-ssi-lab

You can read more about **eassi** at https://ssi-lab.nl. In short:
> As a verifier, you can use eassi as a gateway for requesting and obtaining qualified data, that is data with assurances that you require, e.g. regarding its provenance, integrity, etc. This saves you valuable time and money as you no longer need to validate the data yourselves. As an issuer, you can use eassi as a gateway for providing qualified data, simply by providing such data with assurances. Integrity and provenance are automatically added, and additional assurances may be provided by specifying credential issuing policies.
